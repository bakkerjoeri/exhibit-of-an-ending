[intro]
The electric current you were chasing snakes underneath the wall of the building in front of you. This is the first shelter from the sand and the wind you have come across in three days. It measures a single storey. You see a blue door. Above it a wooden sign painted with bleached blue lettering. It reads "Exhibit of an ending". Night is falling.

[outside]
You stand outside of the "Exhibit of an ending" as it gets darker and colder.

1. Open your notebook
	You pull your notebook out of the leather satchel and flip through its pages. They struggle against the movement, bending this way and that.
	(if !hasPen) You find an empty page and you look through your bag for your pen, but it is nowhere to be found.
	(if hasPen) You find an empty page and take out your pen.
		1. Read the last page.
			The handwriting, yours, shows tired loops and streaks. "I'm on the trail again. The storm has exposed most of the cable along its trail, so it has become somewhat easier to track. It does look thinner here, so our initial estimations were probably incorrect. I would say that this cable was powering one or two buildings. Not enough for our settlement, but it's a start.
		2. (if you have a pen) Write out your findings.
			As you write, a thought occurs. If you report back your settlement will surely jump on this opportunity. Power will stop flowing to this building. You wonder if you should report back.
				1. Continue writing
					This building only contains the past, and contains it while sitting hidden in the middle of nowhere. The power has more use feeding the seeds of another day, flowing through your settlement.
				2. Tear out the page
					There are lessons here. Lessons that are best not forgotten, not by your generation or the next or the one after that. You crumple the torn sheet of paper and put it with the rest of your kindling.
		3. Put your notebook away.
			-> outside
2. Enter the "Exhibit of an ending".
	-> going-inside
3. Leave
	You turn your back on the exhibit and start on your long journey home.

[going-inside]
You step inside. The building radiates pleasently with the retained heat of the day. You see a balance scale, a reclining chair and a writing desk.
	1. Approach the balance scale.
	2. Approach the reclining chair.
	3. Approach the writing desk.
	4. Leave the "Exhibit of an ending".

## The scales
A balance scale sits atop the pedestal. The left-hand plate is towers with a teetering stack of reports. On the right, a single metallic coin of old-world currency.
The scales are tilted in favor of the coin, the reports floating high above.
	1. Read the titles of the reports
		You make out some titles: "Salt levels in the Amazon Rivers", "Effects of the drying air on eczema", "We cannot drink oil", "Bricks to dust: an analaysis of structural damage caused by extreme heat", "Who drank it? Socio-economic effects of water shortage", "Liquid profit: meta-analysis of quarterly earnings of the Big Five in water". 
	2. Examine the coin
		The side facing you shows a map of the earth centered on the North Pole ocean, flanked by two olive branches. The emblem of the United Nations.
			1. Pick the coin up to have a closer look
				As the coin is lifted from its plate the weight of the reports is unleashed. The plate that carries them carreens down and crashes into the pedestal. The pile shudders as it comes to a halt.
				The coin feels cool in palm. It weighs about as much as you'd expect.
				You look at the other side. An icon resembling a drop of liquid reaches up from the silvery base, its metal a blue sheen. Below it you read "10 drams".
					1. Put the coin back
						The coin clinks onto its plate. Slowly, like a rocket in the early stages of take-off, the reports rise. The coin, meanwhile, sinks and sinks. With a soft tap its plate touches the pedestal. The scales rest.
					2. Put the coin in your coat pocket
						The reports sagging with their truth and history, their gravity no longer contested, hold the scales in its uncomfortable tilt.

## A message
A wooden writing desk stands underneath a hanging oil lamp, projecting a weak spotlight onto a thick sheet of recycled stock. A pen lays next to the sheet of paper. It reads: "We tried".

1. Write "We are still trying"
2. Write "Not hard enough"
3. Write "And yet here we are"
4. Write "I know, it's okay"
5. Put the pen in your satchel

## Special thanks to Elon Musk
A reclining chair sits underneath a sky-light.
1. Sit down
	Your aching body welcomes the comfortable chair. Its angle has you looking directly into the sky-light. A clear night sky teems with lights that flicker and move and jitter. Under your right hand you feel a button.
		1. Look at the button
			It is shiny. There is a small brass plaque underneath it. It reads "only the stars"
		2. Push the button
			It starts in the corners. One of the lights blinks out. Then another. At first you try to notice what is leaving, but then your attention turns to what is left behind.
			Some softly flicker, others burn bright. None that remain move. It is still. As you look an old feeling grows. Older than you. Older than the ground this museum was built on.
			Your eyes are at rest, focussed on infinity.
			You forget your thoughts.
			You forget your body.
			Only the stars.
			Then all at once they are back, taking up space, pushing the stars to the background. You snap out of your reverie.
		3. Get up.
		4. Close your eyes.
